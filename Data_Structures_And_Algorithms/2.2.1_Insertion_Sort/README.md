# Insertion Sort

The array is searched sequentially and unsorted items are moved and inserted into the sorted sub-list (in the same array). This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst case complexity are of **ÎŸ(n^2)**, where n is the number of items.

this algorithm is searching linearly in an array and looking for items nusorted and when detected it descendingly insert(swap) this element at proper position.
