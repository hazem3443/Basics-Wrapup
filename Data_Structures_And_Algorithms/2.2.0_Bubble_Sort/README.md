# Bubble Sort

## Sorting Techniques

- In-place Sorting and Not-in-place Sorting
**in place sorting** do not require extra space for sorting
**not in place sorting** requires extra space for sorting operation

- Stable and Not Stable Sorting
**stable sorting** does not change the sequence of similar content in which they appear.

Not Stable Sorting changes the sequence of similar content in which they appear.

- Adaptive and Non-Adaptive Sorting Algorithm
**adaptive algorithm**, if it takes advantage of already 'sorted' elements in the list that is to be sorted.
**A non-adaptive algorithm** is one which does not take into account the elements which are already sorted.

## Bubble Sorting

it is comparison-based algorithm in which each pair of adjacent elements is compared and the elements are swapped if they are not in order.

average and worst case Time complexity are of **ÎŸ(n2)** where **n** is the number of items
