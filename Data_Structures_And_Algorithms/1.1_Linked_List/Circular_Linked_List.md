# Circular Linked List

Circular Linked List is a variation of Linked list in which the first element points to the last element and the last element points to the first element. Both Singly Linked List and Doubly Linked List can be made into a circular linked list.

## Singly Linked List as Circular

In singly linked list, the next pointer of the last node points to the first node.

## Doubly Linked List as Circular

In doubly linked list, the next pointer of the last node points to the first node and the previous pointer of the first node points to the last node making the circular in both directions.

## Basic Operations

- __insert__ − Inserts an element at the start of the list.
- __delete__ − Deletes an element from the start of the list.
